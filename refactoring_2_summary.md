# Refactoring Summary: File Attachment MCP Server Module

This document summarizes the work done to implement the File Attachment MCP Server Module as described in `refactoring_2.md`.

## Overview

The goal of this refactoring was to implement a Web Worker-based MCP server module for file management and semantic search. This allows the application to handle file attachments, chunk them, store them in IndexedDB, and perform searches on their content, all within the browser.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Extension (`src/lib/db.ts`)

- The IndexedDB schema in `src/lib/db.ts` was extended to version 5.
- Three new tables were added:
  - `fileStores`: To manage collections of files.
  - `fileContents`: To store the actual file content and metadata.
  - `fileChunks`: To store text chunks of the files for searching.
- CRUD services and utility functions for these new tables were added to `dbService` and `dbUtils`.

### 2. MCP Module (`src/lib/web-mcp/modules/file-store.ts`)

- A new MCP server module was created at `src/lib/web-mcp/modules/file-store.ts`.
- This module implements the `file-store` server, which provides tools for file management and search.
- A `BM25SearchEngine` class was implemented for keyword-based search using the `wink-bm25-text-search` library.
- The following tools were implemented:
  - `createStore`: Creates a new file store.
  - `addContent`: Adds a file to a store, chunks it, and indexes it for search.
  - `listContent`: Lists the files in a store.
  - `readContent`: Reads the content of a file.
  - `similaritySearch`: Performs a BM25-based search on the content of the files in a store.

### 3. Models (`src/models/search-engine.ts`)

- A new model file was created at `src/models/search-engine.ts` to define the interfaces for the search functionality, including `ISearchEngine`, `SearchOptions`, and `SearchResult`.

### 4. Dependencies

- The `wink-bm25-text-search` dependency was added to `package.json` to enable keyword-based search.

### 5. Context Integration (`src/app/App.tsx`)

- The new `file-store` MCP module was integrated into the application by adding it to the `servers` prop of the `WebMCPProvider` in `src/app/App.tsx`.

### 6. Hooks and UI (`src/features/file-attachment`)

- A new feature directory was created at `src/features/file-attachment`.
- A new hook `use-file-attachment.ts` was created with functions to interact with the `file-store` MCP module.
- Placeholder UI components (`FileUpload.tsx`, `FileList.tsx`, `SearchResults.tsx`) were created.

### 7. Testing

- An integration test for the `file-store` module was added to `src/lib/web-mcp/test-integration.ts`.
- The `testFileStoreModule` method in the `WebMCPIntegrationTest` class tests the creation of stores, adding content, and searching.
- The `WebMCPDemo` component at `src/features/tools/WebMCPDemo.tsx` was updated to include a button to run the integration tests and display the results.

## Notes for Reviewers

- **Core Logic**: The core of the new functionality is in `src/lib/web-mcp/modules/file-store.ts`. This file contains the `BM25SearchEngine` and the `fileStoreServer` implementation.
- **Database Schema**: The new database schema (version 5) can be reviewed in `src/lib/db.ts`.
- **Test Implementation**: The integration test for the new module is in `src/lib/web-mcp/test-integration.ts` in the `testFileStoreModule` method.
- **Running the Tests**: To run the tests, navigate to the "Web MCP Demo" page in the application and click the "Run Integration Tests" button. The results will be displayed on the page.
