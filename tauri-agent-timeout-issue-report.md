# SynapticFlow Tauri Agent: Timeout Issue Report

## 1. System Architecture Overview

- **Platform**: SynapticFlow (Tauri-based AI Agent Desktop Application)
- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri, MCP integration, WebView browser automation)
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Key Module**: `interactive_browser_server.rs` (browser session management and JS eval execution)
- **IPC Flow**: WebView JS → Tauri command (`browser_script_result`) → Rust service (`handle_script_result`)

---

## 2. Issue Summary

- When JS eval is executed from Rust, the result is confirmed in the WebView console.
- JS calls `window.__TAURI__.core.invoke('browser_script_result', { payload })`, triggering Rust's `handle_script_result`.
- Rust logs show consistent IBS instance/process/session_id.
- However, Rust repeatedly encounters a 5-second timeout, logging `No waiting channel for session ... (likely timed out)`.
- This means the sender (waiter) in Rust is already removed when the result arrives, causing a structural issue in result handling.

---

## 3. Event Flow

1. Rust `execute_script` is called → oneshot sender registered → JS eval executed
2. JS runs → result sent to Rust via Tauri IPC
3. Rust `browser_script_result` command executes → internally calls `handle_script_result`
4. In Rust, the sender is already removed (timeout) when the result arrives → result is not received

---

## 4. Structural Characteristics

- session_id, pid, IBS_PTR (instance address) are consistent (single instance/process)
- WebView and Rust IPC are functioning correctly
- There is a potential race condition or logical error in sender (waiter) management

---

## 5. Conclusion

- IPC and JS eval execution are working as expected
- The core issue is that the sender in Rust is removed before the JS result arrives
- Further analysis of sender management logic, session_id handling, and possible race conditions in the code structure is required
