# Streaming Message Fix Test Guide

This document provides a test plan to validate that the streaming message display issue has been resolved.

## Issue Description
Previously, streaming messages would appear briefly and then disappear, only becoming visible again after UI events (window resize, focus, etc.). The root cause was a race condition between clearing streaming state and adding messages to history.

## Fix Summary
The fix involves:
1. **Race Condition Resolution**: Fixed the `useEffect` in `use-chat.tsx` to properly handle streaming updates even when `currentStreaming` is initially null
2. **Smart Message Display**: Modified the `messages` useMemo to intelligently switch from streaming to history when the final message appears
3. **Proper State Synchronization**: Added logic to automatically clear streaming state when the message appears in history
4. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track streaming state changes

## Test Procedure

### Prerequisites
1. Start the application: `pnpm run tauri dev`
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) to monitor console logs
3. Ensure you have an AI assistant configured

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Basic Streaming Display
1. **Action**: Send a simple message to the AI assistant
2. **Expected Result**: 
   - User message appears immediately
   - Streaming assistant message appears immediately with "thinking..." or partial content
   - Message content updates in real-time as AI responds
   - No disappearing/reappearing behavior

#### Test Case 2: Streaming Content Updates
1. **Action**: Send a message that will generate a longer response
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Streaming bubble appears immediately
   - Content gradually builds up character by character
   - Message remains visible throughout the entire streaming process
   - Final message transitions smoothly from streaming to final state

#### Test Case 3: Window Events During Streaming
1. **Action**: 
   - Send a message to start streaming
   - During streaming, resize the window or move it
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Streaming message remains visible before, during, and after window events
   - No flickering or disappearing behavior
   - Content continues to update normally

#### Test Case 4: Tool Calls During Streaming
1. **Action**: Send a message that triggers tool calls (if available)
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Streaming message appears immediately
   - Tool call information is displayed in real-time
   - Message remains visible throughout tool execution
   - Tool result messages appear immediately after execution
   - Final result appears seamlessly without disappearing

#### Test Case 5: Multiple Tool Calls
1. **Action**: Send a message that triggers multiple tool calls in sequence
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Each tool result message appears immediately
   - No disappearing behavior between tool executions
   - Tool results remain visible throughout the process
   - No duplicate tool executions

#### Test Case 6: Error Handling
1. **Action**: Trigger an error condition (disconnect network, invalid API key, etc.)
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Streaming message appears initially
   - Error state is handled gracefully
   - No hanging streaming states
   - Clear error indication

### Debug Information to Monitor

Check the browser console for the following log entries:

1. **From useChatContext**:
   - "Updating currentStreaming with response"
   - "Merging with existing streaming message" or "Creating new streaming message"
   - "Starting new streaming message"
   - "Finalizing streaming message and adding to history"
   - "Final message found in history, clearing streaming state"

2. **From SessionHistoryContext**:
   - "Adding message with optimistic update"
   - "Creating new page with first message" or "Added message to existing page"
   - "Successfully persisted message to DB"

3. **From ToolCaller**:
   - "Executing tool calls for message"
   - "Executing tool call" (for each individual tool)
   - "Submitting tool results"

### Success Criteria

✅ **Pass**: 
- Streaming messages appear immediately upon sending
- Content updates in real-time without disappearing
- Smooth transition from streaming to final state
- No dependency on UI events for message visibility
- Console logs show proper state transitions

❌ **Fail**:
- Messages disappear after appearing briefly
- UI events are required to see messages
- Console shows errors or missing state transitions
- Streaming state gets stuck or doesn't clear properly

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check:

1. **Console Errors**: Look for React state update warnings or errors
2. **Network Issues**: Ensure AI service is responding properly
3. **Database Issues**: Check that messages are being persisted correctly
4. **Context Provider Order**: Verify that providers are nested correctly in App.tsx

## Performance Notes

The fix maintains good performance by:
- Using efficient `useMemo` dependencies
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- Properly cleaning up streaming state
- Using optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback

## Code Files Modified
- `tauri-agent/src/hooks/use-chat.tsx`: Main streaming logic fixes
- `tauri-agent/src/context/SessionHistoryContext.tsx`: Enhanced logging for debugging
- `tauri-agent/src/components/orchestrators/ToolCaller.tsx`: Fixed tool result display issues and duplicate execution prevention

## Additional Notes
- The fix uses React's built-in state management and doesn't require external libraries
- Debug logging can be disabled in production by adjusting log levels
- The solution is compatible with existing context provider architecture
