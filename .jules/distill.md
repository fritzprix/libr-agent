## 2024-05-24 - [Avoid over-formatting list handlers with redundant markdown blocks]
**Learning:** Returning nested Markdown tables directly to LLM without explicitly declaring backticks for data constraints (such as `agent.id` and `sessionId`) reduces parsing stability and drops vital constraints.
**Action:** When refactoring MCP Tools for tabular data, always explicitly quote ID fields and maintain strict structure without repeating conditional checks (`if !results.is_empty()`) for block-level additions.
