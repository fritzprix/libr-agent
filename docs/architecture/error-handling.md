# Error Handling in LibrAgent

This document describes the error handling strategies used throughout the application.

## 1. Frontend Error Handling

- **User-Facing Errors**: User-facing errors are displayed using a notification system (e.g., toasts) to provide immediate feedback without disrupting the user experience.
- **Try/Catch Blocks**: All calls to Tauri commands and other asynchronous operations are wrapped in `try/catch` blocks to handle potential failures gracefully.
- **Error Boundaries**: React Error Boundaries are used to catch rendering errors in component subtrees and display a fallback UI.

## 2. Backend Error Handling

- **Result Type**: Rust's `Result<T, E>` type is used extensively in the backend to handle operations that can fail. This ensures that all potential error cases are handled explicitly.
- **Descriptive Error Messages**: Error messages returned from Tauri commands are designed to be descriptive enough to aid in debugging, but generic enough not to expose sensitive information.

## 3. MCP Server Error Handling

- **JSON-RPC Errors**: Errors that occur during tool execution in an MCP server are returned as standard JSON-RPC error objects. This allows the frontend to distinguish between communication errors and tool-specific errors.
- **Process Panics**: The application includes a panic handler to gracefully manage crashes in MCP server processes, preventing them from taking down the entire application.
